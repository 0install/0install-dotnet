  <summary>.NET Core version of 0install, the decentralized installation system</summary>
  <description>This is the .NET Core version of Zero Install. Zero Install is a cross-platform, decentralized installation system. Instead of having a central repository in which all software is placed under a naming scheme managed by some central authority, programs and libraries in Zero Install are identified by URIs. Anyone who can create a web-page can publish software. Anyone can install software (not just administrators).</description>
